# Code structure

One folder per responsibility, a thin `mod.rs` per folder (declarations, re-exports and the folder's
documentation), tests next to the code. This page is the map; `kitsune_core/src/structure.rs` enforces
the dependency rules of the core.

## The tree

  lib.rs      re-exports every module at the crate root (`kitsune_core::fs3`), see below

kernel/src/                  bare metal: drivers, scheduler, framebuffer, wasm host, desktop glue

    mod.rs        the `Desktop` struct, its constructor and the prelude shared by the folders
    frame.rs      per-frame stepping, the scheduler quantum, dirty-region bookkeeping
    compositor/   scene composition, layers, damage, present
    windows/      chrome, cursor, instance (Kind/App/Inst), lifecycle, geometry, drag, Alt+Tab
    shell/        model (Shell state, commands), step, panel/, taskbar/, overlays/ (Apps, Busca,
                  dialog), toasts, language-change hook
    input/        keys, clipboard, pointer (+ press, drag, hover), click, wheel
    kit/          ui/ (toolkit), charts, appui, appart, glass, widgets, live (hover clock)
    services/     vfs (desktop file API), sysstore (sysif implementations), shellhost/ (shelld)
    apps/<app>/   files viewer editor terminal browser tarefas registro ajustes calculadora wasm
                  gallery : state, input, paint (and a few concern files) in one folder
  wasm/ fb/ ...   other kernel subsystems (unchanged)
```

Names: folders are the Portuguese app names where the app is user-facing (`registro`, `ajustes`,
`tarefas`, `calculadora`), English elsewhere. Files are named by concern (`state`, `input`, `mouse`,
`keys`, `paint`, `step`, `layout`, `tests`), never by "ui" vs "logic". A file is split when it passes
~600 lines, along the existing `// ----` section seams. `mod.rs` holds only `mod` lines, re-exports and
the folder doc.

## Dependency rules (core)

`group -> allowed groups` (own group always allowed). Enforced by
`cargo test -p kitsune_core structure::`: an edge outside this table, a stale entry in the table and a
flat `crate::gfx` path used inside the crate all fail.

| Group | May use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `format` | nothing | leaf: codecs and small utilities |
| `hw` | `network`, `storage` | drivers implement the block-device and MAC types |
| `i18n` | `hw` | locale formatting reads the RTC types |
| `security` | nothing | leaf: accounts, password hashing and permission rules take everything as arguments |
| `storage` | `security` | `secured` enforces the permission rules; storage never knows drawing, windows, network or apps |
| `network` | `format` | Unix time for certificate dates |
| `browsing` | `format`, `i18n`, `network`, `ui` | decoders, TLS, redirects, motion preference |
| `platform` | `browsing`, `format`, `i18n`, `storage` | HTTP response parsing, manifests, app volume |
| `ui` | `format`, `i18n`, `windowing` | wallpaper decoding; chrome is drawn around `Rect`/taskbar geometry |
| `windowing` | `format`, `i18n`, `ui` | style tokens and motion; substring search |
| `system` | `format`, `hw`, `i18n`, `ui`, `windowing` | settings use style/wallpaper, notify uses window geometry |
| `apps` | `format`, `i18n`, `platform`, `storage`, `system`, `ui`, `windowing` | app logic sits on top; nothing depends on `apps` |

The only mutual dependency between groups is `ui <-> windowing` (`anim`, `chrome`, `layout`, `widgets`,
`cursor` use `window::Rect` and the taskbar geometry; `window` uses `style`, `winman` uses `anim`).
A new edge that closes another cycle should be a design discussion, not a table edit.

The crate root re-exports every module under its old flat name (`kitsune_core::fs3` is
`kitsune_core::storage::fs3`) so the kernel, fuzz targets, benches and tools did not change. Inside the
crate, always use the grouped path (`crate::storage::fs3`).

## Dependency rules (kernel desktop)

`apps/*` may use `kit`, `services`, `shell` (menus, toasts), `windows` and `kitsune_core`; apps do not
use each other (shared things go to `kit` or `services`). `kit` and `services` do not use `apps`.
`windows` knows the app *kinds* (`instance.rs`) but not their internals. `input` dispatches to `apps`
through `Desktop` methods. Folder modules are `pub(super)`; what other folders need is re-exported in
the folder's `mod.rs`, and `desktop/mod.rs` keeps the short prelude (`ui`, `appui`, `vfs`, state types).

## Checklists

**New app** (a window kind):
1. Pure logic and its tests: `kitsune_core/src/apps/<app>.rs` + `<app>/tests.rs`.
2. `kernel/src/desktop/apps/<app>/` with `mod.rs` (doc, `mod` lines, re-export of the state type),
   `state.rs`, `input.rs`, `paint.rs`.
3. `windows/instance.rs`: a `Kind` variant with its metadata, an `App` variant, `App::new`.
4. `input/click.rs`, `input/keys.rs` (and wheel/hover) route to the new `Desktop` methods; `windows/chrome.rs`
   `draw_window` draws it; `shell/taskbar/state.rs` `DEFAULT_PINNED` if it starts pinned.
5. Strings: `assets/i18n/pt.txt` and `en.txt`; `cargo test -p kitsune_core i18n`.
6. `tools/verify-boot.sh` (desktop unchanged) and a scenario screenshot.

**New window kind that is not an app** (a tool window): same as an app, no launcher entry
(`Kind` metadata `multi`/`resizable`).

**New overlay or popover**: state in `shell/model.rs`, drawing in `shell/overlays/` (full screen) or
`shell/panel/popovers.rs` (hangs from the panel), entry point in `shell/overlays/layers.rs`, layer order in
`compositor/layers.rs`, keys in `shell/overlays/keys.rs`, pointer in `shell/overlays/pointer.rs`.

**New driver**: register-level code in `kernel/src/<driver>.rs`; parsing and state machines in
`kitsune_core/src/hw/<driver>.rs` with tests; IRQ handlers do not allocate or lock.

**New core module**: pick the group by responsibility (table above); `pub mod` in the group's `mod.rs`;
add the flat re-export to `lib.rs`; tests in `<module>/tests.rs`; if it needs a group that is not allowed,
rethink the placement before editing the table in `structure.rs` and this page.

**New WASM example**: `wasm-apps/examples/<name>/` (workspace-detached crate, SDK path `../../sdk`);
the images only bundle `clock`, `notes`, `paint` and `snake` (`BUNDLED_APPS` in `kernel/build.rs`).
