//! Desktop compositor: window manager, app rendering, open/close animations,
//! and a process table surfaced through a Tarefas app.
//!
//! All non-trivial logic (terminal, editor, keymap, window geometry, easing,
//! process table, the dynamic window table) lives in `kitsune_core` and is
//! unit-tested. This module is hardware-facing glue: pixels, animation
//! stepping, dispatch, and one [`instance::App`] state per window.
