//! The compositor: one frame of the desktop, from "something happened" to pixels on screen.
//!
//! ```text
//!   Desktop state ──build_scene──▶ Scene ──Engine::plan──▶ Plan { damage, steps }
//!                                                              │
//!        framebuffer ◀──upload damage── back buffer ◀──paint steps (bottom to top)
//!        (+ toasts, HUD, cursor: framebuffer only)
//! ```
//!
//! There is exactly one rendering path. A drag, a keystroke, a clock tick, an animation, a
//! popover opening and a window leaving the screen all reach the engine as the *same kind of
//! input* (a changed scene, an invalidated rectangle), and the engine answers with the damage
//! and the paint calls: no cached "static layer", no per-case repaint code, no signature to
//! extend. See `docs/design/compositor.md` for the design, the invariants and how to extend it.
//!
//! Files: `layers.rs` describes the desktop as a scene, `paint.rs` paints a layer, `present.rs`
//! owns the buffers and the framebuffer-only passes (toasts, HUD, cursor), `verify.rs` is the
//! debugging check that the incremental screen equals a full redraw.
