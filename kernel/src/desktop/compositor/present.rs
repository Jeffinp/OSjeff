//! Getting pixels to the screen: the back buffer, uploads of damage rectangles to the
//! framebuffer, and the three things that live **only in the framebuffer** and are never part of
//! the scene: the toast banners, the performance HUD and the mouse cursor.
//!
//! Invariant: outside those three, the framebuffer equals the back buffer after every frame. The
//! compositor changes the back buffer only inside the plan's damage and uploads exactly that, so
//! the two cannot drift apart. The framebuffer-only things follow a protocol that makes each
//! restorable from the back buffer:
//! - the cursor is erased first and painted last (`osjeff_core::cursor`);
//! - after an upload that touched the HUD's or a toast's rectangle, that thing is drawn again.
