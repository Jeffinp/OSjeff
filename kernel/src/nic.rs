//! Network interface abstraction: the [`Nic`] trait every driver implements, the
//! [`Port`] that owns one and counts what crosses it, and [`probe`], which picks
//! the NIC at boot.
//!
//! Ownership is the whole point of this layer. There is exactly one `Port`; it is
//! moved into the network owner (`netd`, which runs on the `fetcher` thread), so
//! the compiler, not a state machine and a comment, guarantees that a single party
//! touches the hardware. Everything above the driver (the DHCP client, the ARP and
//! ping responder, smoltcp) talks to `&mut Port` and never names a concrete NIC.
//!
//! Selection at boot: virtio-net if the PCI bus has one, else the NE2000 ISA card
//! if one answers, else no network.
