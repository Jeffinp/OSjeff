//                                       |  (caller gave up before the worker started: back to IDLE)

// ```
//
// An abandoned job still runs to its own end (a fetch cannot be interrupted half way), but its
// result is dropped, and nobody can post another job until the worker has returned the mailbox
// to IDLE.
