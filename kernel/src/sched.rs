//! Preemptive round-robin kernel scheduler with blocked threads.
//!
//! Each thread owns a heap-allocated stack and a saved stack pointer. The PIT
//! timer fires a naked ISR (see `interrupts`) that saves the full interrupted
//! context, calls [`switch_current`] to pick the next thread, and restores +
//! `iretq`s into it — so any thread is preempted on a timer tick without
//! cooperating. New threads are launched by fabricating an initial stack frame
//! that the ISR epilogue + `iretq` "resume" into the entry function.
//!
//! # Blocked threads
//!
//! Each thread has a wake-up tick in `WAKE`; it is *runnable* iff
//! `WAKE[i] <= now` (0 = ready, [`FOREVER`] = parked until [`wake`]). The ISR
//! round-robin skips threads that are not runnable, so an idle worker costs no
//! slice. A thread blocks itself with [`block`] (which also hands the CPU over
//! at once through the yield vector, [`yield_now`]) and is released by the tick
//! reaching its deadline or by [`wake`]. If nothing at all is runnable the ISR
//! leaves the current thread in place; every wait loop re-checks its condition
//! after `hlt`, so that is safe. All of this state is plain atomics, so the ISR
//! (IF=0, never allocates) and thread code can share it without locks.
//!
//! Tarefas's per-thread "CPU" counts only the timer ticks that found
//! the thread *running* (`IDLE` marks the ones spent in `hlt`).
//!
//! # Dead threads
//!
//! A thread other than the compositor (slot 0) that panics, takes a CPU
//! exception or trips its stack canary is not allowed to stop the machine: it is
//! marked *dead* (`DEAD`), never scheduled again, and the CPU is handed to
//! another thread without returning to it ([`kill_current`], or the ISR itself
//! for the canary). The compositor, a fault with interrupts off (inside an ISR or
//! a spin lock: the interrupted code held state nobody can repair), a double
//! fault, and any fault *while* a thread is being killed stay fatal
//! (`crash::die`). Resources a dead thread owned are not reclaimed: its stack and
//! whatever it had allocated stay allocated, and a lock it held without
//! disabling interrupts stays held. The heap lock cannot be one of those, because
//! it keeps interrupts off while held (see [`containable`]).
