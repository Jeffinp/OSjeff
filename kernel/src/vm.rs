//! Minimal access to the active page tables, for thread-stack guard pages.
//!
//! The kernel does not own its page tables: the bootloader built them and maps all
//! physical memory at `physical_memory_offset` (`Mapping::Dynamic`, see `main.rs`).
//! That mapping is enough to *edit* them: walk from CR3 to the level-1 entry of a
//! page and clear its `PRESENT` bit (then `invlpg`), which turns the page into one
//! whose every access is a #PF. The heap, where thread stacks live, is part of the
//! kernel image's `.bss`, which the bootloader maps with 4 KiB pages, so one page can
//! be unmapped without splitting anything; if a walk ever meets a 2 MiB/1 GiB page the
//! functions here refuse ([`Error::HugePage`]) rather than edit a mapping that covers
//! more than the page asked for.
//!
//! Which entry to read at each level, and whether it can be descended into, is
//! decided by `osjeff_core::paging` (tested on the host); this file only does the
//! unsafe memory access.
