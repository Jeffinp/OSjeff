//! Pure x86_64 paging arithmetic and thread-stack layout with a guard page.
//!
//! The kernel walks the bootloader's page tables (through the physical-memory
//! mapping) to take one page out of a thread stack's block: a *guard page* below
//! the stack, whose `PRESENT` bit is cleared so a stack overflow faults instead of
//! silently writing into whatever the heap put next to it. The `unsafe` walk lives
//! in `kernel/src/vm.rs`; the decisions it makes (which table index at which
//! level, whether an entry may be descended into, how a block splits into guard
//! and stack, whether a faulting address hit a guard) are here, where they are
//! tested on the host.
